/**
 * Build-output classifier (#2885 — successor to the retired
 * `app/__tests__/isr-routes.test.ts` line scanner).
 *
 * Once `cacheComponents: true` is on (#2835) the production build itself
 * rejects most of the patterns the old line scanner caught — a regression
 * fails compile, not lint. So this test deliberately does NOT try to
 * recreate the build's own ƒ-Dynamic guard. Instead it covers the gaps
 * the build cannot:
 *
 *   1. Parse-guard. The build summary is captured to disk by the vitest
 *      globalSetup (`test-setup/run-prod-build.ts`), but terminal output is
 *      not a stable API. The classifier reads `.next` artifacts first and
 *      only falls back to stdout when artifacts are unavailable.
 *
 *   2. Classification drift (the load-bearing assertion). For each
 *      must-stay-cacheable route we encode the EXPECTED glyph — `◐`
 *      (Partial Prerender) or `○` (Static) — and assert the build
 *      classified it that way. The build already fails on `ƒ`; what
 *      it does not catch is e.g. an `◐` route accidentally collapsing
 *      to `○` (lost a `<Suspense>` boundary, lost a dynamic island —
 *      no longer streams personalised data) or vice-versa (`○` legal
 *      page accidentally pulled in a server-side fetch). Both shapes
 *      compile cleanly but represent semantic regressions.
 *
 *   3. Routes-of-interest list freshness. If a route in the must-stay
 *      list was deleted or renamed in the source tree, the route key
 *      stops appearing in the build artifacts/summary. The list rots silently —
 *      we'd think we were guarding a route we no longer ship. The
 *      "expected this route in build artifacts/summary" assertion catches that.
 *
 * Background incident: #2243 (ISR-leakage CPU-quota incident — a single
 * dynamic-API leak on `/[lang]/company/[slug]` blew the monthly Vercel
 * function quota). The old line scanner caught this in lint; the new
 * test catches the residual classes that survive `cacheComponents: true`.

 *
 * - `static` (○ Static) is the right answer for pages with zero dynamic
