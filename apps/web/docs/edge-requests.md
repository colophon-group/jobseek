# Edge Requests & Rendering Strategy

## How it works

The app splits pages into **static** (served from CDN, zero edge cost) and **dynamic** (rendered per-request on edge functions) using Next.js App Router conventions.

### Static pages (public, auth)

Public marketing pages and auth pages contain no user-specific data. They are **pre-rendered at build time** for every locale via `generateStaticParams` in `app/[lang]/layout.tsx`:

```
/en/              — static
/de/              — static
/en/how-we-index  — static
/en/terms         — static
/en/privacy-policy — static
/en/license       — static
/en/sign-in       — static (client component layout)
/en/sign-up       — static
/en/check-email   — static (client component, reads sessionStorage)
/en/verify-email  — static (client component, reads ?token query param)
```

These pages produce **zero edge function invocations** — Vercel serves them directly from the CDN.

### Dynamic pages (app, API)

Pages that check authentication or read cookies are rendered on every request:

```
/en/app/*         — dynamic (reads headers() for session)
/api/auth/*       — dynamic (Better Auth handler)
```

This is correct — these pages genuinely need per-request data.

### Middleware

The middleware only runs for paths **without** a locale prefix (e.g. bare `/`, `/how-we-index`). It redirects to the locale-prefixed version based on `Accept-Language`.

Paths that already have a locale prefix (`/en/...`, `/de/...`) **skip the middleware entirely** — no edge invocation.

### Theme

Theme is handled entirely client-side by `next-themes`. It injects an inline script that sets the `class` attribute on `<html>` before first paint. No server-side cookie reading needed.

### Locale on `<html lang>`

The root layout sets `lang="en"` as default. An inline script reads the locale from the URL pathname and updates `document.documentElement.lang` before first paint. This avoids reading `cookies()` in the root layout, which would force all pages to be dynamic.

## Rules to avoid unnecessary edge requests

### Never use `cookies()` or `headers()` in shared layouts

The root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) and the locale layout (`app/[lang]/layout.tsx`) must **never** call `cookies()`, `headers()`, or any function that reads request data. These layouts are shared by every page — a single dynamic call here forces the **entire app** into per-request rendering.

If you need request data, put it in a **route-group layout** that only wraps the pages that need it (e.g. `(app)/layout.tsx`).

### Keep `generateStaticParams` in `[lang]/layout.tsx`

This tells Next.js which locale variants to pre-render. Without it, `[lang]` is treated as a fully dynamic segment and every page requires an edge invocation.

### Keep the middleware matcher narrow

The middleware matcher explicitly excludes locale-prefixed paths. When adding a new locale, **add it to the matcher exclusion list** in `middleware.ts` — otherwise every request to that locale will unnecessarily invoke the middleware.

### Use route groups to separate static from dynamic

```
app/[lang]/
  (public)/    ← no cookies/headers in layout → static
  (auth)/      ← client component layout → static
  (app)/       ← reads headers() for auth → dynamic (intentional)
```

If you add a new section, choose the right route group. Don't put static content pages inside `(app)/`.

### Don't read cookies/headers for cosmetic data

For things like theme preference, locale, or UI state — handle client-side. Only use `cookies()`/`headers()` for data that genuinely requires server involvement (authentication, authorization, signed tokens).

### Check build output for static vs dynamic

After `pnpm build`, Next.js prints a summary showing which routes are static (`○`) and which are dynamic (`λ` or `ƒ`). Verify that public pages show as static. If a page unexpectedly shows as dynamic, check its component tree for `cookies()`, `headers()`, `searchParams`, or `fetch` with `cache: 'no-store'`.

### Never call useAuth() / useSession() on public pages

This is one of the most impactful rules for edge request cost.

Better Auth's `useSession()` hook fires a `GET /api/auth/get-session` request
on mount. This is both an **edge request** and a **serverless function
invocation** — the two billable Vercel metrics. It also re-fires on every
**window focus** event (rate-limited to 5 seconds), so tab-switching during a
single visit generates repeated requests.

**Current rule**: public pages always render the anonymous CTA state. Auth
checks only happen inside the `(app)` route group, where the user is already
authenticated and the session check is genuinely needed.

If a future feature needs auth-dependent UI on a public page (e.g. showing
a user avatar in the header), consider one of these alternatives instead of
re-adding `useSession()`:

- **Non-httpOnly cookie hint**: Set a lightweight `logged_in=1` cookie
  (non-httpOnly) at sign-in. Client JS can check `document.cookie` without
  a network request. Clear it on sign-out.
- **Deferred component**: Use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` to load the
  auth-dependent fragment only after the main page renders, so it doesn't
  block or slow initial paint.

## SessionProvider — zero-cost client auth

The `(app)/layout.tsx` already fetches the session server-side via
`getSession()`. Instead of having client components re-fetch it with
`authClient.useSession()` (which triggers `GET /api/auth/get-session`),
we pass the session through React context:

```
Server: (app)/layout.tsx → getSession() → <SessionProvider user={session.user}>
Client: useAuth() → reads from SessionProvider context (zero network requests)
```

**What this eliminates:**

- `GET /api/auth/get-session` on every app page mount
- Re-fetch on every window focus event (tab switching)
- localStorage caching workaround (no longer needed)

**Trade-off:** If the session changes externally (e.g. user changes name on
another tab), the data won't refresh until the next page navigation. This is
acceptable because account changes already redirect the user, causing a fresh
server render.

The `useAuth()` hook in `src/lib/useAuth.ts` is a thin wrapper over
`useSession()` from `SessionProvider.tsx`.

## Cached session deduplication

`src/lib/sessionCache.ts` wraps `auth.api.getSession()` with React's
`cache()`. This deduplicates session lookups within a single server render:

```
(app)/layout.tsx  → getSession()  → DB query #1
getPreferences()  → getSession()  → cache hit (no query)
getAccountPageData() → getSession() → cache hit (no query)
```

Without caching, each call independently queries the database for the same
session token. With `cache()`, only one query runs per request.

**Note:** `cache()` scopes to a single request. Separate HTTP requests
(e.g. client-triggered server actions) each get their own cache scope.

## Server-side data fetching for app pages

App pages fetch data in their server components and pass it as props to client
components. The data rides along with the RSC navigation payload — no extra
network request after mount.

**Key principle:** Avoid `useEffect` → server action fetch patterns on page
load. These create a sequential waterfall: the browser first downloads the RSC
payload (page shell), then mounts the component, then fires a second request
for data. Fetching in the server component collapses this into a single request.

### Account settings page

`getAccountPageData()` returns connected accounts in the page server component
and passes them as `initialData` to `<AccountSettings>`:

```
Before: RSC navigation (60ms) → mount → server action (280ms) = 2 requests, 340ms
After:  RSC navigation (~80ms, includes DB query)             = 1 request,  80ms
```

The server action uses the neon HTTP driver (stateless, fast) to query the
`account` table. It does NOT use `withRLS` — the `account` table has no RLS
policies, and the query filters by `userId` from the validated session.

Client-side re-fetching (`refreshAccounts`) is only used after user-initiated
mutations (e.g. setting a password), not on page load.

### General settings page

No server-side data fetching needed. Theme comes from `next-themes`
(`useTheme()`), locale comes from the URL. Both are available client-side
without a DB query.

### When adding new app pages

Follow this pattern: fetch data in the page server component, pass as props.
Only use client-side fetches for data that changes after user interaction
(e.g. refreshing account list after linking a social provider).

### Performance consideration: withRLS

The `withRLS` helper uses the WebSocket Pool driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`
Pool) to run queries inside a transaction with `set_config('app.current_user_id', ...)`.
This has **significantly more overhead** than the stateless HTTP neon driver
(`neon()`) used by `db`:

- WebSocket connection establishment / pool acquisition
- Transaction overhead (BEGIN → set_config → query → COMMIT = 4 round-trips)
- ~150-200ms total even though each individual Neon query runs in <10ms

**Rule:** Never use `withRLS` in the page-load critical path if avoidable.
For read-only queries where the `WHERE` clause already filters by the
authenticated `userId`, prefer the HTTP driver (`db`) with no RLS wrapper.
Reserve `withRLS` for mutations and sensitive operations where defense-in-depth
matters (e.g. `updatePreferences`, `recordPasswordResetRequest`).

## Link prefetch strategy

Next.js `<Link>` prefetches the RSC payload for every linked route when the
link enters the viewport. Each prefetch of a dynamic route is an edge request.

We disable prefetch on all links except high-conversion cross-page paths.

### Hot paths (prefetch **enabled** — default)

These are the links users are most likely to click next. Prefetching them
improves perceived navigation speed.

| Link | Location | Href | Why hot |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| "How do we index" | Header nav, Mobile menu | `/how-we-index` | Cross-page nav link, high interest |
| Log in CTA | Header, Mobile menu | `/sign-in` | Primary action |
| Hero primary CTA | Hero section | `/sign-in` | Main conversion funnel |
| Pricing CTAs | Pricing cards | `/sign-up` | Conversion funnel |

### Cold paths (prefetch **disabled**)

These links either point to the same page (anchor links), are rarely clicked,
or the user is already on an adjacent page.

| Link | Location | Href | Why cold |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| Product | Header nav, Mobile menu | `/` | Same-page anchor |
| Features | Header nav, Mobile menu, Hero | `/#features` | Same-page anchor |
| Pricing | Header nav, Mobile menu | `/#pricing` | Same-page anchor |
| License | Footer | `/license` | Legal — rarely clicked |
| Privacy | Footer | `/privacy-policy` | Legal — rarely clicked |
| Terms | Footer | `/terms` | Legal — rarely clicked |
| Sign in ↔ Sign up | Auth form | `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` | User is already on an auth page |
| Back to sign in | Verify email (error) | `/sign-in` | Error recovery path |
| Continue | Verify email (success) | `/app` | User will click immediately |
| Logo (auth) | Auth layout | `/app` | Same-app navigation |
| App nav icons | AppHeader (desktop) | `/app`, `/app/settings` | Dynamic pages behind auth |
| App bottom bar | AppHeader (mobile) | `/app`, `/app/settings` | Dynamic pages behind auth |

### When adding new links

- **Cross-page link on a public page likely to be clicked?** → Leave prefetch as default (enabled).
- **Same-page anchor, legal page, or low-traffic route?** → Add `prefetch={false}`.
- **Inside the `(app)` route group?** → Add `prefetch={false}` (dynamic pages behind auth).
- **Inside `Button` component?** → Pass `prefetch={false}` as a prop; it forwards to `<Link>`.

## Font loading

Fonts are loaded via `@font-face` declarations in `globals.css` with
`font-display: swap`. The browser only downloads a font file when it
encounters text using that specific weight.

**Do not add `<link rel="preload">` for fonts.** Preload hints combined with
`@font-face` cause browsers to download each font **twice** — once from the
preload and once from the CSS. This was previously doubling font bandwidth
(~376 kB × 2 = ~752 kB wasted per page load).

Fonts are cached for 1 year with `immutable` via `Cache-Control` headers in
`next.config.ts`. After the first visit, fonts are served from browser cache.

## Asset caching

Static assets use `Cache-Control` headers (configured in `next.config.ts`) to
reduce repeat edge requests.

| Asset | Cache TTL | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Fonts (`/fonts/*`) | 1 year, `immutable` | Never change between deploys |
| `next/image` responses (`/_next/image`) | 1 week (`minimumCacheTTL`) | Default is 60s — far too short |
| SVGs, PNGs in `public/` | 1 week | Rarely change; no content hash in URL |
| JS/CSS chunks (`/_next/static/*`) | 1 year, `immutable` | Content-hashed filenames (Next.js default) |
| Favicon, manifest, icons | 1 week | Rarely change |

Vercel purges its CDN cache on every deploy. Browser caches persist for the
configured TTL — this is acceptable because these assets rarely change.
If a `public/` asset does change, browsers will pick up the new version
within a week.

## ThemedImage — single-image strategy

`ThemedImage` renders a **single** `<Image>` tag for the active theme instead
of rendering both light and dark variants with CSS `display: none` toggling.

The previous dual-image approach caused browsers to download **both** images
for every themed image on every page (logos, screenshots, artwork), doubling
edge requests. On Vercel each request is a billed edge request.

The current client-component approach uses `useTheme()` to pick the right
source. It defaults to dark during SSR (matching `defaultTheme="dark"`) and
swaps after hydration if the user is in light mode. `next-themes` injects a
blocking script that resolves the theme before first paint, so there is no
visible flash.
