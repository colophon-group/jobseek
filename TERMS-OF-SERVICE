We aggregate publicly available job postings from employer career
pages. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness
of any job posting or employer information displayed on the Service.

     certain features. You are responsible for maintaining the

     violate these Terms.

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

     immediately. Provisions that by their nature should survive
     termination (including Sections 5, 6, 7, and 11) will survive.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of
Germany. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or

revise the "Last updated" date at the top. If the changes are
material, we will make a reasonable effort to notify you (e.g. via

publication constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
