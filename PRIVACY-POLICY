2. DATA WE COLLECT

  a. Account data
     When you sign in via an OAuth provider (e.g. Google, GitHub) we
     receive and store:
       - your name,
       - your email address, and
       - your profile picture.
     We do not receive or store your password. We do not request access
     to your contacts, calendar, files, or any other data held by the
     OAuth provider beyond the basic profile information listed above.

  b. Usage data
     As you use the Service we store the data you create, including
     but not limited to saved companies, job postings, alert
     preferences, and application tracking information.

  c. Technical data
     We collect anonymous, aggregated page-view analytics through
     Vercel Analytics. This data contains no personal identifiers and
     does not use cookies.


3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (GDPR Art. 6)

  We process personal data on the following bases:
    - Contract (Art. 6(1)(b)):  to provide and maintain the Service
      you signed up for.
    - Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):   where you have given consent, e.g. by
      opting in to job-alert notifications.
    - Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)):  to improve, secure, and
      maintain the Service (anonymous analytics).


4. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA

  We use the data described in Section 2 to:
    - authenticate your identity,
    - provide the core features of the Service (saved companies, saved
      job postings, job-search alerts),
    - send you job-alert notifications you have opted in to, and
    - understand usage patterns and improve the Service (anonymous
      analytics only).

  We do NOT:
    - sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for
      marketing or advertising purposes,
    - use your data to build advertising profiles, or
    - make automated decisions that produce legal effects concerning
      you.


5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

  The Service relies on the following third-party processors. Each
  operates under its own privacy policy.

  a. OAuth providers (authentication)
     We use third-party OAuth providers (e.g. Google, GitHub) to
     authenticate users. We receive only the basic profile information
     listed in Section 2(a). Each provider's use of your data is
     governed by its own privacy policy.

  b. Vercel (hosting and analytics)
     The Service is hosted on Vercel. Vercel Analytics collects
     anonymous, cookie-free page-view data. Vercel's privacy policy:
     https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy

  c. Neon (database)
     Your account and usage data is stored in a managed PostgreSQL
     database provided by Neon. Data is encrypted at rest. Neon's
     privacy policy:
     https://neon.tech/privacy-policy


6. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

  - All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS / TLS.
  - Data at rest is encrypted by the database provider (Neon).
  - We do not store your OAuth provider password.
  - Access to production systems is restricted to authorised
    personnel.
  - We review our security practices periodically and apply updates
    as needed.


7. COOKIES

  The Service uses only strictly necessary cookies for session
  management and authentication. We do not use advertising, tracking,
  or analytics cookies. Vercel Analytics operates without cookies.


8. YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR)

  If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United
  Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have the following rights under the
  General Data Protection Regulation:

    - Access:          request a copy of all personal data we hold
                       about you.
    - Rectification:   ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete
                       data.
    - Erasure:         request deletion of your account and all
                       associated data ("right to be forgotten").
    - Data portability: receive your personal data in a structured,
                       commonly used, machine-readable format.
    - Restriction:     ask us to limit processing of your data.
    - Objection:       object to processing based on legitimate
                       interest.
    - Withdraw consent: revoke consent at any time (e.g. by deleting
                       your account or contacting us). Withdrawal does
                       not affect the lawfulness of processing before
                       withdrawal.

  To exercise any of these rights, email us at the address in
  Section 1. We will respond within 30 days. If you are unsatisfied
  with our response, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your
  local data protection supervisory authority.


9. DATA RETENTION

  We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active.
  If you delete your account, all associated personal data will be
  permanently removed from our database within 30 days. Anonymous
  analytics data that cannot be linked back to you may be retained
  indefinitely.


10. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

  Your data may be processed on servers located in the United States
  (Vercel, Neon). Where data is transferred outside the EEA, we rely
  on the processor's Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful
  transfer mechanisms.


11. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

  The Service is not directed at children under the age of 16. We do
  not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a
  child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we
  can delete it.


12. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we
  will revise the "Last updated" date at the top. If the changes are
  material, we will make a reasonable effort to notify you (e.g. via
  a notice on the Service). Your continued use of the Service after
  publication constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
